Pinshot is my Pinterest inspired attempt at trying to do something similar.

## Building your project

Feel free to use. Below is the process to get the project running:

1. Cloudinary account.
2. Mongo db account.
3. Brevo.
4. Server env files - MONGODB_URI, JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN, HOST, BREVO_MAIL_KEY, PORT, USER_MAIL_LOGIN, BREVO_PORT, BASE_URL.
5. Client env files - VITE_BASE_URL, VITE_CLOUDINARY_URL, VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET.
6. Once you fill up with your own keys, start the project on your local machine.
